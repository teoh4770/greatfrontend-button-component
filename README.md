# Challenge 3: Button Component

I complete this challenge to improve my foundation of HTML and CSS.

In this challenge, I focus on achieving:
- [X] Semantic & Accessible HTML
- [X] CSS that follow CUBE (Composition, Utility, Block, Exception) methodology
- [X] CSS states: hover, focused, active, disabled

## üì¶ Technologies/Methods
- <code>HTML/CSS</code>
- <code>CSS nesting</code>

For this simple challenge, I just use simple HTML/CSS and follow the best practices.
Create button variations with data attributes to set different variants, states, sizes and icons.

üìö What I Learned
- Has a quick refresher on CUBE methodology.
- Use CSS variables to make CSS changes easily.
